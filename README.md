!) GIT TERMINOLOGY:
> commits
  - Essentially a snapshots of the files that you have within a particular folder (called a repository, or repo) on your system.
  - Each commit contains the changes youâ€™ve made to the files since the last commit, so you can easily rollback those changes (much like a Windows System Restore point).

> repository (repo)

> staging
  - After creating a Git repo, you have to tell Git which files you want to version control by staging them with the git add command.
  - Staging simply adds the files to an index that represents the files that Git can take a snapshot/commit of.

!) GIT CONFIGURATION ON CLIENT MACHINE:
> git config
  $ git config --global user.name "PLeoK"
  $ git config --global user.email "przemek.kaminski6@gmail.com"

!) TO TURN AN EXISTING FOLDER INTO A GIT REPO:
> When in the directory you want to turn in to repo:
  $ git init

!) STAGE FILE(S) FOR COMMIT:
> use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed (tracked files)
  $ git add <filename>

!) TAKING SNAPSHOT TO REPO:
> After the files have been staged, you can take snapshots of them using the git commit command.
  $ git commit
